# [CMT Board Game](https://szludora.github.io/CMT-Table/)
This is a game where you can play a similar game to Tic-Tac-Toe, but instead of Xs and Os, you play with three units: C, M, and T. If you manage to align at least three identical letters in a row, column, or diagonal, it counts as a match. At the end of the game, the result is displayed depending on your success and how many matches you achieved.
