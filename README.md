# [CMT Board Game](https://szludora.github.io/CMT-Table/)

This is a web-based implementation of the CMT (C, M, T) board game that runs in your browser. The game provides an interactive 5x5 grid where you can place the characters "C", "M", and "T" in a round-robin order. The goal of the game is to align three or more consecutive identical characters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once a line is formed, it changes color to indicate the alignment, with green for "C", blue for "M", and red for "T".

You can try out the [game here](https://szludora.github.io/CMT-Table/).
