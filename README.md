# [CMT Board Game](https://szludora.github.io/CMT-Table/)

This is a web-based implementation of the CMT (C, M, T) board game that runs in your browser. The game provides an interactive 5x5 grid where you can place the characters "C", "M", and "T" in a round-robin order. The goal of the game is to align three or more consecutive identical characters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once a line is formed, it changes color to indicate the alignment, with green for "C", blue for "M", and red for "T".

You can try out the [game here](https://szludora.github.io/CMT-Table/).

## Features

- **Round-robin placement:** The game cycles between "C", "M", and "T" as you click on the cells.
- **Line detection:** Three or more identical characters aligned in a row, column, or diagonal will change color to indicate a line.
- **Score display:** Once the board is full, the game will display how many lines you have formed, or if you have no lines at all.
- **Reset button:** You can reset the game at any time to clear the board and start over.
- **Theme toggle:** Switch between different visual themes to customize your playing experience.
- **Snapshot/ Screenshot:** Capture the current state of the game with a screenshot functionality.
- **Sound effects:** Enjoy sound effects for different actions in the game, including:
  - Clicking on the cells.
  - Successful line formation (successful feedback).
  - Failed attempt (failed feedback).
  - Camera action sounds when taking a snapshot.
